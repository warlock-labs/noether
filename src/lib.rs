//! # Nœther
//!
//! Nœther provides traits and blanket implementations for algebraic structures,
//! from basic ones like magmas to more complex ones like fields. It also includes
//! linear algebra structures like vector spaces and tensors.
//!
//! Named after Emmy Nœther, a pioneering mathematician in abstract algebra,
//! this library aims to bridge the gap between abstract mathematics and practical
//! programming in Rust.
