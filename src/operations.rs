//! Algebraic operations and their properties.
//!
//! This module defines traits for algebraic operations and their properties,
//! such as commutativity, associativity, and distributivity. These properties
//! are fundamental to algebraic structures and define their behavior.
//!
//! # Algebraic Properties
//!
//! - **Closure**: An operation ⊕ on a set S is closed if for all a, b ∈ S, a ⊕ b ∈ S
//! - **Commutativity**: An operation ⊕ is commutative if a ⊕ b = b ⊕ a for all a, b
//! - **Associativity**: An operation ⊕ is associative if (a ⊕ b) ⊕ c = a ⊕ (b ⊕ c) for all a, b, c
//! - **Distributivity**: An operation ⊗ distributes over ⊕ if a ⊗ (b ⊕ c) = (a ⊗ b) ⊕ (a ⊗ c) for all a, b, c
//! - **Identity**: An element e is an identity for ⊕ if e ⊕ a = a ⊕ e = a for all a
//! - **Inverse**: For an element a and identity e, b is an inverse if a ⊕ b = b ⊕ a = e

// A note on the reasons why certain traits are used:
//
// The `Inv` trait is the multiplicative inverse operation.
// The `One` trait is the multiplicative identity operation.
// The `Zero` trait is the additive identity operation.
// The `Neg` trait is the additive inverse operation.
