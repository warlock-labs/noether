/// Represents a Euclidean Domain, an integral domain with a Euclidean function.
///
/// # Mathematical Definition
/// A Euclidean Domain (R, +, ·, φ) is a principal ideal domain equipped with a
/// Euclidean function φ: R\{0} → ℕ₀ that satisfies certain properties.
///
/// # Formal Definition
/// Let (R, +, ·) be an integral domain and φ: R\{0} → ℕ₀ a function. R is a Euclidean domain if:
/// 1. ∀a, b ∈ R, b ≠ 0, ∃!q, r ∈ R : a = bq + r ∧ (r = 0 ∨ φ(r) < φ(b)) (Division with Remainder)
/// 2. ∀a, b ∈ R\{0} : φ(a) ≤ φ(ab) (Multiplicative Property)

/// Represents a Field, a commutative ring where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.
///
/// # Mathematical Definition
/// A field (F, +, ·) is a commutative ring where:
/// - Every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse
///
/// # Formal Definition
/// Let (F, +, ·) be a field. Then:
/// 1. (F, +, ·) is a commutative ring
/// 2. ∀ a ∈ F, a ≠ 0, ∃ a⁻¹ ∈ F, a · a⁻¹ = a⁻¹ · a = 1 (multiplicative inverse)

/// Represents a Finite Field, a field with a finite number of elements.
///
/// # Mathematical Definition
/// A finite field is a field with a finite number of elements.
///
/// # Properties
/// - The number of elements is always a prime power p^n

/// Represents an Ordered Field, a field with a total order compatible with its operations.
///
/// # Mathematical Definition
/// An ordered field is a field equipped with a total order ≤ where:
/// - If a ≤ b then a + c ≤ b + c for all c
/// - If 0 ≤ a and 0 ≤ b then 0 ≤ a · b

/// # Mathematical Definition
/// A real field is an ordered field that is Dedekind-complete:

/// Represents a Field Extension.
///
/// # Mathematical Definition
/// A field extension L/K is a field L that contains K as a subfield.
///
/// # Properties
/// - L is a field
/// - K is a subfield of L
/// - L is a vector space over K

/// Represents a Tower of Field Extensions.
///
/// # Mathematical Definition
/// A tower of field extensions is a sequence of fields K = F₀ ⊂ F₁ ⊂ ... ⊂ Fₙ = L
/// where each Fᵢ₊₁/Fᵢ is a field extension.
///
/// # Properties
/// - Each level is a field extension of the previous level
/// - The composition of the extensions forms the overall extension L/K
/// - The degree of L/K is the product of the degrees of each extension in the tower
